## Introduction üëã

Next Portfolio is built using Next.js and Tailwind CSS for a modern design and rapid development. TypeScript is utilized for code clarity and safety. Additionally, Firebase is being integrated for backend services such as realtime-database. The result is a dynamic and functional portfolio website that showcases the developer's skills and experience.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kish202/Tania-portfolio.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm i
   ```

3. Create a Firebase project and select the web app

4. Create an `.env.local` file in the root directory, and add the following variables with your firebase config:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL= your firebase url
   SENDINBLUE_SMTP_USER= xxxxxxxx
   SENDINBLUE_SMTP_PASS=xxxxxxx
   SENDINBLUE_SENDER_EMAIL=Email from
   MAIL_TO=email to
   ```
   <!-- write text to tell user to get sendgrid keys from dashboard and add here -->

> **Note**: `SENDINBLUE_SMTP_PASS` - Create an API key from "Settings"

2. Import json data

   - Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com) and select your project
   - Go to "Database" -> "Realtime Database" -> "Import JSON" and import the [data.json] file

3. Run the project

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Deployment üöÄ

1. Create a Vercel account and select "Import Project"

2. Select the forked repository and deploy

3. Add the following environment variables in the Vercel dashboard:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL= your firebase url
   SENDINBLUE_SMTP_USER= xxxxxxxx
   SENDINBLUE_SMTP_PASS=xxxxxxx
